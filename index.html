    This demonstrator shows how Fortune's Algorithm can be used to
    construct a Voronoi diagram from a set of points. To start the
    demonstration, either add points to the plane below and press
    "Start Algorithm", or try one of the demo diagrams with the 
    buttons above. The algorithm will start with the sweep line at
    the very top and handle all events sequentially on its way down.
    The red points on the plane represent circle events that are 
    also handled by the sweep line to check for possible Voronoi
    edges.

    This is an open source demonstrator, built by Christopher Oser. The implementation is largely
    based on the source code of Raymond Hill <a href="https://github.com/gorhill/Javascript-Voronoi">https://github.com/gorhill/Javascript-Voronoi</a>.
    Many thanks and praises go out to Mr. Hill.
